## Hi, I'm Emily ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚

### I'm a student interested in the many applications of CS-- from developing ML models for disease classification, to competitive programming, and building smaller projects for hackathons.

AI in healthcare research
, particularly quantum computing.




I’m a student interested in math, CS, and bioinformatics—especially where they intersect. I love solving hard problems, whether through AI-driven research, competitive programming, or mathematical modeling. Lately, I’ve been working on computational biology research to improve drug discovery and gene expression analysis.

Right now, I’m refining ProLiDE to integrate multi-source biological data for drug discovery and improving BioRSP to analyze gene expression heterogeneity. When I’m not coding, you can find me reading sci-fi, playing the guitar, or exploring new places. I’m also passionate about education and mentorship, helping students worldwide access STEM opportunities and develop their skills. 🔮(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و
